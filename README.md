# DnD Maps

This repo is where I keep all the maps I make for DnD.


# Printing

Most maps are planned to be broken up into 8"x10" images for the purpose of printing out on 8.5"x11" paper with 0.25" side-margins and 0.5" top-margins.

Each folder contains a full image of the map, a `print/` directory with the map broken up into printable sections, and a `build.sh` that coverts the full image into the broken up ones.
